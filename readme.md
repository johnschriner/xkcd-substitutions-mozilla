# xkcd-substitution-mozilla
Forked from LizardLab

Derived from the work of Chris Wright's [cloud-to-butt-mozilla](https://github.com/DaveRandom/cloud-to-butt-mozilla) Firefox extension. Based on the [XKCD comic](http://xkcd.com/1288) on a suggestion of how to make the news more fun.


## Installing

Download [XKCD-sub3.xpi](https://github.com/johnschriner/xkcd-substitutions-mozilla/blob/master/XKCD-sub3.xpi?raw=true)


## Building

1. Download the code, open FireFox.
2. Create whatever edits to the .js that you have or audit it, whatever.
3. Save the file as a .zip and then rename the file extension to .xpi. [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Bundles) is the directory structure of _what_ exactly to zip.
4. Click *Add-ons* from the *Tools* menu and select the *Extensions* tab.
5. Drag-and-drop the XPI file onto the page and it may make you edit your about:config.
6. Enjoy reading the news in style.
